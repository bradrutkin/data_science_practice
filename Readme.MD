##Learning Data Science 
### This is my quest through Joel Grus's book 'Data Science From Scratch'

The code on here serves three purposes 
	1. Practice my coding and learn data science skills
	2. Help me document my progress and take notes on the book 
	3. Be used as examples for future employers 

All the code on here was originally based on the code from the book or Joel's github page, however the comments are all original to me and the code was updated from python 2.7 to 3.5.
